pyCAPLunar is a python package to create the receiver-side 3D strain Greens' function (SGT) and Greens' function (the displacement, DGF). 
It also uses waveform fitting to determine the moment tensor of earthquake sources and 
uses the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method to estimate the posterior probability of the inversion result as its uncertainty.
