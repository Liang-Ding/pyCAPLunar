# pyCAPLunar
pyCAPLunar is a python package that utilizes the stain Green's tensor database in 3D models and the waveform-based inversion method called the Cut-And-Paste (CAP) to simultaneously determine the source location and full moment tensor that is parameterized by the Lune diagram. Besides, with the utilization of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method, it can also estimate the uncertainty of the inversion results.
