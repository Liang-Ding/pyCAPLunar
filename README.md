# pyCAPLunar
pyCAPLunar is a python package that utilizes the stain Green's tensor database in 3D models to simultaneously determine the source location and moment tensor. It is based on a widely used waveform-based inversion method called the CAP (cut-and-paste) method and the parameterization of general moment tensor by fundamental Lune.
